# React Interview Challenge: Designing a Weather Dashboard

## Objective

Your task is to design and implement a weather dashboard application that provides users with relevant weather data.

## Background

You've been given access to a backend that offers weather information. This includes current conditions, a 3-day forecast, and historical data.

## Requirements

### 1. User Interface

The application should be user-friendly, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing.

### 2. Search Capability

Users should be able to search for weather information based on location.

### 3. Weather Overview

On selecting a location, the application should display an overview of the current weather condition.

### 4. Forecast

Users should be able to view a forecast for the next three days for their chosen location.

### 5. Historical Data Access

Provide users with an option to explore historical weather data.

## Considerations

- Think about the reusability of your components. How can you design them so they can be used in multiple parts of the application or even in future applications?
- Consider the scalability of your design. If the application's features were to expand, how easy would it be to integrate new components or features?
- Keep in mind the user's experience. The design should be coherent and easy to navigate.

## Bonus

Imagine this application is part of a larger suite of tools. How would you design your components to ensure they could be used across different parts of the suite?

## Discussion Points for Post-Implementation

### 1. Component Hierarchy

Can you explain the hierarchy and structuring of your components? Why did you decide to break down the components the way you did?

### 2. Styling and User Experience

Talk us through your design choices. How did you ensure a seamless user experience across the application?

### 3. Code Quality and Best Practices

Discuss any patterns or best practices you've employed in your solution. Were there any challenges you faced, and how did you overcome them?
